# Usage
The backend app 'server.js' requires 3 environment variables to be configured in .env:

* PORT: The port on which the backend will listen
* APIKEY: The API key for OMDB, can be set up at the OMDB site https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
* MYSQLPASS: Password for msSQL database

When the app is running, launch the web app at 'index.html' or 'newuser.html', jumpiung straight onto any of the other pages without logging in will cause errors so don't do it please :)
